Introducing the 3D arm! It's a special prosthetic (like a fake arm) made using 3D printing and Arduino mechanical circuits

What's cool about it is that it's customizable, easy to fix, and not too expensive. This means people 
who need it can get a prosthetic that fits them well without spending too much money. 
And because it's easy to fix, they won't have to worry too much if something breaks. 

By combining these features, the 3D arm provides individuals with limb differences a transformative experience, 
enhancing their quality of life and restoring a sense of mobility and independence. This technology represents
